MUSIC Walter was asked to contribute to the score by licensingsome of his music through his publisher Universal Music. Hewas also tasked to write tracks and additional arrangementswhich were used in the show and in several marketingcampaigns for NETFLIXs new smash-hit series.  To capture the unnerving vibe of the series Walter employeda large selection of drums and found sounds.From big-scale taiko drums to re-amped finger snips, nopercussive instrument was too large or too small to add to adense soundscape.  For the more etherial and atmospheric soundscapes Walterused his large scale modular synth rig. Adding vintageeffects helped blend sounds and ingest an emotionalcomponent that describes the desperation of the charactersin the show."
